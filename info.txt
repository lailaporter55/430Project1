● What dataset are you using?
    I have decided to use the books dataset. 
● What work has been completed for this milestone?
● What work is left, and how do you plan to complete it?

● Do you have a plan for going above and beyond? If so, what is it?
    
● If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from?
What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
