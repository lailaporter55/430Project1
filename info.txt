● What dataset are you using?
    I have decided to use the books dataset. 
● What work has been completed for this milestone?
    I have setup my files and repository. I started to write my code and created a plan for how my project will go. I worked on the server.js, jsonResponses.js, and htmlResponses.js. 
● What work is left, and how do you plan to complete it?
    I will need to add more to the client side and to the index.html. I will need to add more creativity to the project, this will be in the css and for what my code will do instead of having just the basics. For my code I am going to create a library application. Users will be able to request, checkout, search, and add books. I will need to add more POST and GET requests. 
● Do you have a plan for going above and beyond? If so, what is it?
    I am thinking about it. I will definitly add CSS and make the project look pretty. I know the CSS will not equate to all of the points if I have enough time to add more I definitly will. I was thinking about trying to look for my own dataset if I have time as well, but I think I would have to redo too much of the project at that point. 
● If you used any borrowed code or code fragments, where did you get them from?
    I used Professor Willoughby's repository and refrenced the example code from class. 
What do the code fragments do? Where are they in your code?
